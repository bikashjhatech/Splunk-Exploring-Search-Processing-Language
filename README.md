# Splunk-Exploring-Search-Processing-Language

I completed the Splunk: Exploring Search Processing Language (SPL) course on TryHackMe. Throughout the course, I gained valuable insights into filtering search results, structuring data, and using transformational commands in SPL. I learned to work with commands such as Fields, Search, Dedup, Rename, Table, Head, Tail, Sort, Reverse, Top, Rare, Highlight, Stats, Chart, and Timechart. Each of these commands has broadened my understanding of how to efficiently manipulate and analyze data in Splunk. This course has deepened my knowledge of SPL, and Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.
